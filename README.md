# ember-sudoku-solver

A simple ember.js app that solves sudoku puzzles. It reads .txt files (via the HTML5 FileReader API) that contain a 9x9 grid of X's and numbers, solves the puzzle, and displays the solution, which can also be downloaded as a .txt file.

Example puzzle .txt files can be found in the 'puzzles' directory, and solutions generated by the app for the example puzzle files are in the 'solutions' directory.
